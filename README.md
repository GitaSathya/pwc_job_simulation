1. Enhanced Data Visualization Expertise: Developed dynamic PowerBI dashboards that effectively conveyed key performance indicators (KPIs), demonstrating my ability to design solutions that meet client requests with precision and clarity.
2. Strong Communication: Leveraged my communication skills to provide concise and informative email updates to engagement partners, offering valuable insights and actionable suggestions grounded in data analysis.
3. Analytical Problem-Solving: Focused on examining HR data, with a particular emphasis on gender-related KPIs, I identified root causes for gender balance issues at the executive management level, reinforcing my commitment to data-driven decision-making.
   
This project reflects my technical proficiency, strong communication abilities, and dedication to addressing client needs through data-driven solutions. I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals or explore opportunities where these skills can add value.
